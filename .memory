## Long Term
- Feature (UI Components):
  1. Material-UI (MUI) has been installed as the UI component library
     - Core packages: @mui/material, @mui/icons-material
     - Required peer dependencies: @emotion/react, @emotion/styled
     - Roboto font: @fontsource/roboto
     - Theme configuration has been set up in src/theme/

## Short Term
- [MEDIUM] Consider creating reusable MUI components
  - File: `src/components/`
  - Context: As the application grows, create reusable UI components using MUI

## Learning
- Following the Six-Phase Development Workflow is essential for all changes
- Use Graphite (gt) commands for PR creation
- Avoid feature creep and focus only on requested changes
