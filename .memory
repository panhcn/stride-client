## Long Term
- Feature (UI Components):
  1. Material-UI (MUI) has been installed as the UI component library
     - Core packages: @mui/material, @mui/icons-material
     - Required peer dependencies: @emotion/react, @emotion/styled
     - Roboto font: @fontsource/roboto
     - Theme configuration has been set up in src/theme/
- Feature (Testing):
  1. Consider adding component testing examples for common patterns
     - Form validation testing
     - Async component testing
     - Context provider testing
  2. Explore adding E2E testing with Cypress for critical user flows
     - Authentication flow
     - Main user journeys
  3. Consider setting up test coverage thresholds in CI pipeline
     - Minimum 80% coverage for new code
     - Focus on component and utility function coverage

## Short Term
- [MEDIUM] Consider creating reusable MUI components
  - File: `src/components/`
  - Context: As the application grows, create reusable UI components using MUI
- [MEDIUM] Complete test setup with sample tests
  - File: `src/App.test.tsx`
  - Context: Basic component test to validate Vitest setup

## Learning
- Following the Six-Phase Development Workflow is essential for all changes
- Use Graphite (gt) commands for PR creation
- Avoid feature creep and focus only on requested changes
- Testing Framework:
  1. Vitest provides better integration with Vite than Jest
  2. @testing-library/react v16.3.0+ supports React 19
  3. Co-locate test files with components for better organization
